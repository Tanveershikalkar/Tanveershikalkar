Introduction

My name is Tanveer Shikalkar, a passionate and driven individual pursuing a master's degree with a specialization in marketing and business analytics. With a strong foundation in both these fields, I have dedicated my academic and professional journey to mastering the art of strategic decision-making, data-driven insights, and consumer behavior analysis.

Throughout my career, I have gained valuable experience through various projects and internships, including a 50-day marketing internship at Shoppers Stop, where I honed my skills in market research, brand equity analysis, and customer satisfaction studies. My work on projects like "A Study of Consumer Behaviour with Special Reference to Shoppers Stop, Kolhapur" and "A Study of Brand Equity with Special Reference to Shoppers Stop, Kolhapur" has equipped me with a deep understanding of the retail sector and the intricacies of brand management.

Currently, I am focused on leveraging my expertise to create innovative solutions in the health and wellness domain, with a particular interest in developing personalized yoga platforms for individuals seeking to improve their health. My goal is to blend my knowledge of marketing, analytics, and technology to make a positive impact on people's lives.

I am also in the process of building a portfolio website to showcase my projects and accomplishments, which reflect my commitment to excellence and my ability to bridge the gap between data and strategic business decisions.
